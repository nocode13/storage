### How to create entity and use it?

- Go to `src/entities`, create folder with the name of your entity, for example `user`
- In entity slice, we can create only these segments, `ui, model, lib, config`.
- Business logic segments should be files (`model, lib, config`), for example to create `model` for `user`:

*src/entities/user/model.ts*
	
    const userAuthenticated = createEvent()
		
	const userModel = { userAuthenticated, ...other user units }
    export default userModel //important, babel transform plugin works only with default exports 
    
*src/entities/user/index.ts*
	
    export { default as userModel } from './model'
    export { default as userLib } from './lib'
	...
    

- `ui` segment should be always folder, with public api (`index.ts`).
- For example, we have `UserCard` component, it should be placed in `src/entites/user/ui/card.tsx`, pay attention to the name of the file, it is important.
- The export of the component must be **default**.
*src/entities/user/ui/card.tsx*
	
        const UserCard = () => ...;
		
		export default UserCard
    
*src/entities/user/ui/index.ts*
	
    export { default as UserCard } from './card'
    

- Overall, the `user` slice file structure will look like this: 
	- src
	  - entities
		- user
		  - index.ts (public api of slice)
		  - model.ts
		  - config.ts (optional)
		  - lib.ts (optional)
		  - ui
			- index.ts (public api of ui segment)
			- card.tsx
			- avatar.tsx
			- table.tsx


#### Why we need this export rules?
When using public api (exporting all components from single file), there are issues with bundle size. For example, in `user` slice, we have several ui components, in layout we should render user avatar from slice, in first load, the main chunk will inlcude components (files) from user slice because of public api where we have our re-exports. The only solution which keeps benefits of public api and prevents large bundle size problem is transforming imports in runtime using babel. **These rules are appliable only for entity layer**.

#### How does babel import transform work?
For example, in `widgets/layout/model.ts` we should read `$user` store from `entities/user/model.ts`.

*src/widgets/layout/model.ts*
	
	import { userModel } from 'entities/user' 
	
    export const $username = userModel.$user.map(user => user.username)

The `import { userModel } from 'entities/user'` line will be transformed during build to the `import userModel from 'entities/user/model'`. Without this transformation, the main chunk will include whole `user` slice (ui components, lib functions, etc.)
With ui components, transformation in most is the same, `import { UserCard } from 'entitees/user'` will be `import UserCard from 'entities/user/ui/card.tsx'`.
